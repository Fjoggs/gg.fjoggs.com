### Feedback

#### GT1

- Add small platform to wall, allowing jump from LG ledge to small platform and then to RA
- Swap MH with 50H and place MH somewhere else
    - Maybe where YA is
    - Health pickup feels dominated by upper area, and maybe too much spread
        - No stack player runs around at 50 hp most of the times
- Swap low RL and PG

#### Dojo
- Getting RA is needlessly complicated

#### Fjo3tourney6
- Teles are annoying, pull triggers further out

#### Fatamorgana
 - 2x 25H has Z-fighting`

#### Trespass
- Teleporter are brighter than a thousand suns
