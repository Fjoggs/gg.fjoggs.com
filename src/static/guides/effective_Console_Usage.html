<h2 id="quickrecap">Quick recap</h2>
<p>This is not a beginner's guide to the console, but I will summarize a quick information recap in here.</p>
<ul>
<li>The console is a command-line interface that lets you type in commands, change and see variable values.</li>
<li>To activate or deactivate the console, you press the tilde key (~).</li>
<li>The bottommost line always contains the current user input buffer.</li>
<li>Once you're done typing your message or command, you press enter for the system to execute it.</li>
<li>The caret is the blinking cursor that is either an underscore (_) or a full rectangle block (�).</li>
<li>All commands start with a leading slash (/) or backslash (\).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't type the leading slash or backslash in front of your text and press enter:</p>
<ol>
<li>If in-game, it will send a global chat message.</li>
<li>If not in-game, the game will add a leading backslash for you.<br />
In other words, it considers everything to be a command.</li>
</ol>
<p>The 2 insertion modes are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>When the caret is a small underscore (_), a new character gets inserted (added) where the caret is.</li>
<li>When the caret is a full rectangle block (�), a new character replaces the character where the caret is.</li>
</ol>
<p>Variables accessible through the console are called <em>console variables</em> or <em>cvars</em> for short.</p>
<h2 id="autocompletion">Auto-completion</h2>
<p>Running auto-completion (by pressing tab) can be used to help speed up several processes:</p>
<ul>
<li>To list variables and commands starting with a certain string pattern after you've typed at least one character.<br />
Example: type in <code>r_</code> and then press tab to get a list of all renderer variables.</li>
<li>To add the leading backslash.<br />
Example: to vote cpm3a, you can type in <code>cv map cpm3a</code>, press tab and then enter.<br />
The auto-completion recognizes that cv is a command and will add the leading backslash.</li>
<li>To speed up typing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="shortcommandaliases">Short command aliases</h2>
<p>Certain commands and vote strings have short aliases to reduce typing:</p>
<p>| Alias | Command |
|:------|:--------|
| cv    | callvote |
| wr    | weaponrespawn |
| falldamage | fallingdamage |
| limit | scorelimit |
| ot | overtime |
| gp | gameplay |
| thaw | thawtime |
| tl | timelimit |
| ref | referee |
| unref | unreferee |
| mute | mutespecs |</p>
<h2 id="detailedconnectioninfo">Detailed connection info</h2>
<p>Use the <code>cstats</code> command to check your ping range for both client-to-server and server-to-client.<br />
With no argument, it gives you information for yourself.<br />
The command can take a player ID if you want to see the stats of someone else.  </p>
<h2 id="search">Search</h2>
<p>There are 2 very useful commands for searching variables and commands, called <code>cvarlist</code> and <code>cmdlist</code>.<br />
The awesomest property they have is the * matching syntax.<br />
The * will try to match as many characters as possible that do not match the following pattern.</p>
<p><code>cvarlist crosshair</code> will print out all variables that start with the word <em>crosshair</em>.<br />
<code>cvarlist *crosshair</code> will print out all variables that contain the word <em>crosshair</em>.</p>
<p>The cvarlist command displays a bunch of letters in front of the variables it found. They describe variable types.</p>
<h2 id="variabletypes">Variable types</h2>
<p>Variable types get printed out as a single character when using the <code>cvarlist</code> command.</p>
<p>|   | Category     | Description / Remarks  |
|:-:|:-------------|:-----------------------|
| S | server info  | sent in response to front-end requests |
| s | system info  | these cvars will be duplicated on all clients |
| U | user info    | sent to server on connect or change |
| R | ROM          | display only, cannot be set by user at all |
| I | init         | don't allow change from console at all, but can be set from the command line |
| A | archive      | used for system variables, not for player specific configurations |
| L | latched      | will only change when C code next does a Cvar<em>Get() call |
| C | cheat        | can not be changed when sv</em>cheats is 0 |
| ? | user created | unknown to the game and created by a set command |</p>
<h2 id="usingcvtoqueryvalues">Using <code>cv</code> to query values</h2>
<p>The <code>callvote</code> command can be used to display help and query current CPMA/OSP server settings.<br />
<code>cv</code> will query the help and give you a list of all the things that can be voted.  </p>
<p>Suppose that after reading the help, you're interested in the <em>gameplay</em> category.<br />
<code>cv gameplay</code> will display the help of that category, showing you what can be voted.<br />
It will also tell you what the current gameplay mode is.</p>
<h2 id="osphelpsyntax">OSP help syntax</h2>
<p>Most commands that require at least 1 argument will display some help if you invoke them with no argument.<br />
Example: <code>callvote</code></p>
<p>However, some commands can be run without any argument, like <code>cstats</code>, so a different method is needed to display the help.<br />
OSP commands have a special argument for querying the help: <code>?</code>.<br />
Example: <code>cstats ?</code></p>
<h2 id="commandswithclientnumbers">Commands with client numbers</h2>
<p>Several commands require a client number as an argument, like <code>kick</code>, <code>remove</code>, <code>cstats</code>, etc.<br />
Most of those now support passing a player name (without color codes) and will tell you if there's any ambiguity preventing execution.</p>
<h2 id="pastingfromtheclipboard">Pasting from the clipboard</h2>
<p>You can ctrl+c text on the desktop and paste it with ctrl+v into the console.<br />
This is mostly used for entering IP addresses for the <code>connect</code> command.</p>
<h2 id="thetogglecommand">The <code>toggle</code> command</h2>
<p>Toggles a cvar between a set of defined values.  </p>
<p>Syntax: toggle cvarname [value1 value2 value3...]  </p>
<p>So, what does it do with integers?</p>
<ul>
<li>when no argument is passed:  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>if the cvar is not 0, it becomes 0<br />
  if the cvar is 0, it becomes 1  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>when there are arguments:<br />
  if the current isn't on the list, it sets the cvar to the first one in the list<br />
  if the current value is in the list, it set the cvar to the next one (with wrap-around) in the list  </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So, for a cvar with possible values 0, 1 and 2, having the bind <code>bind space "toggle cvarname 0 1 2"</code> means every time you press the space bar, the cvar will toggle to the next possible value.</p>
<h2 id="findingthelasterror">Finding the last error</h2>
<p>After an error occurred, the error message can be found in the cvar <code>com_lastError</code>.<br />
This cvar will not be defined before at least 1 error happened.</p>
<h2 id="quotesandcommandchaining">Quotes and command chaining</h2>
<p>Command arguments are separated by spaces (<code></code>), commands by semi-colons (<code>;</code>).<br />
The problem is that sometimes, you need one of those characters inside an argument.<br />
The solution to this is enclosing the entire argument in double quotes (<code>"</code>).  </p>
<p>Command chaining is mostly useful for binding multiple actions to a single key/button.</p>
<p>Example: <code>bind space "drop;weapnext"</code> to drop the current weapon and select the next one (otherwise you get the pummel).<br />
Note that <code>bind space drop;weapnext</code> would execute <code>bind space drop</code> and then <code>weapnext</code>.</p>
<h2 id="theresetcommand">The <code>reset</code> command</h2>
<p>Resets a cvar to its default value.</p>
<p>Syntax: reset cvarname</p>
<p>The current and default values can be queried with <code>/cvarname</code>.</p>
<h2 id="thesetcommandfamily">The <code>set</code> command family</h2>
<p>Sets a cvar to a value. If the cvar doesn't exist, it gets created.</p>
<p>Syntax: set cvarname value</p>
<p>| Command | Flag | Explanation |
|:--------|:-----|:------------|
| set  | none |  |
| seta | archive | save to the config |
| setu | user info | sent to server on connect or change |
| sets | server info | sent in response to front end requests |</p>
<h2 id="thevstrcommand">The <code>vstr</code> command</h2>
<p>Executes the content of a variable as a command.</p>
<p>Syntax: vstr cvarname</p>
<p>Example #1: with <code>set rage quit</code>, <code>vstr rage</code> will execute <code>quit</code></p>
<p>Example #2: connection scripts<br />
In a read-only config: <code>set roboty connect roboty.cpmpickup.eu:27961;password lobstarz</code><br />
In-game: <code>vstr roboty</code> to connect to the server</p>
<p>Example #3: alternating smiley<br />
<code>set smiley1 "say ^5:);set smiley vstr smiley2"</code><br />
<code>set smiley2 "say ^6:);set smiley vstr smiley1"</code><br />
<code>set smiley vstr smiley1</code><br />
<code>bind space vstr smiley</code></p>
